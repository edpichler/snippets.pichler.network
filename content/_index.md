## Software Engineer and Entrepreneur

I have more than a decade of experience in the software industry. I have designed and worked in on all phases of the development cycle, requirements, design, construction, quality assurance, working on the construction of new products and also maintaining established ones. I have done it for several platforms, like desktop, web, hardware integration and mainframes. I worked for companies and also co-founded my own. I love technology, automation, and entrepreneurship.
  
My specialty is software, and having working as CTO in the companies I co-founded, I realized my old dream of conducting the ship being an entrepreneur. I had succeeded. It also brought me experiences in many areas. I loved it. I invested my personal time in learning how to be a good leader, delegate, give people autonomy, create a meaningful work to people, give regular feedbacks, take good and fast decisions, start small and learn fast, automate as much as possible, etc. I worked very hard and I have a lot of fun at same time. I saw the results of the experiences and every decision we have done. I loved that so much that I never felt tired.
  
Besides work, I like sports (surfing, snowboarding and swimming), books, movies, photography, nature, travel and, foremost, staying with family and friends.

## What I have been using
I will not list a lot acronymns here just because I have used but I want to mention some I have liked to work with: 
 * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) is currently my language of choice. It's *Java on steroids*. *(I also like other languages)*
 * [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/)
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source), [Swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Containerization is the new virtualization and I got hooked even before it was cool.
 * [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/): Because streams > queues.
 * Nginx + Certbot (to proxy everything to my docker cluster and making the stack hibrid, cloud agnostic and having encrypted communication).
 * Apache Avro. In case JSON is to slow you can serialize to bytes and massively increase the bandwith between your systems and even have a strict schema as a contract. I missed a lib like this in 2008.
